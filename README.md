## Working Mode

The road-map consists of several steps. In each step, a set of theoretical concepts are explored, supported by reference documentation, book chapters, tutorials and videos. In parallel, a simple application will be built with the learned concepts: the *Online Shop* application.

After the learning material for a given step was sufficiently explored, either some new functionality will be added to this application or old functionality will be refactored.

All the code written must be published on GitHub. Access the [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/Ch8FVRTf) to create your own repository. Commits must be pushed when each individual chapter is finished. In order to request a code review from the trainers, you must [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from the `develop` to the `master` branch.

## Environment

You can work using your local environment:
 - You need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Online Shop
The application will simply browse through a catalog of products. It will support:

 - Listing the products,
 - Adding a new product,
 - Updating an existing product,
 - Deleting a product.
